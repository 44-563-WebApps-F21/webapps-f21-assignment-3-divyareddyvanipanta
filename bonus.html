        <h1>The Black Vargas</h1>
        <p>
            Vargas is a supervillain in the Marvel Universe. The character, created by Chris Claremont and Salvador 
            Larroca, first appeared in X-Treme X-Men #1 in 2001. Within the context of the stories, Vargas comes 
            into conflict with the X-Men while searching for the diaries of Destiny and even managed to kill
             Psylocke. He's not a mutant, since he lacks the X-Gene in his DNA, but is not fully human either, 
             much like Captain America is a relatively perfect human physical specimen. He is genetically perfect 
             and claims to be "homo superior superior", humanity's "natural response" to the emergence of mutants, 
             and possesses super-strength and speed in addition to highly advanced combat skills
