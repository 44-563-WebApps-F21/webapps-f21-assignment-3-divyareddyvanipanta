        <h3>My favourite location in the world is Paris</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Paris</b> is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. People call Paris <b>"City of Love"</b> 
            because of the romatic atmosphere and <b>Eiffel tower</b> is one of the world's most recognizable 
            landmarks.<br>
            Especially as it glows after dark have made it one of the most visited monuments in the world. 
            Also Paris is a nation of food lovers, all these put together made me like Paris.
