        <h3>My favourite location in the world is Paris</h3>
        <p>
            <b>Paris</b> is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. People call Paris <b>"City of Love"</b> 
            because of the romatic atmosphere and <b>Eiffel tower</b> is one of the world's most recognizable 
            landmarks.<br>
            Especially as it glows after dark have made it one of the most visited monuments in the world. 
            Also Paris is a nation of food lovers, all these put together made me like Paris.

        <h3>Finding Power of Factorial Divisor</h3>
        <blockquote cite="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-maximum-power-number-divides-factorial/">The idea is based on Legendreâ€™s formula which finds largest power of a prime number that divides
            fact!. We find all prime factors of n. For every prime factor we find largest power of it that divides 
            fact!. Finally we return minimum of all found powers.
