        <h1>Black Panther</h1>
        <p>
            Black Panther is a 2018 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name.
            Seeking to address the dearth of Black characters in comics, Lee and Kirby created T’Challa, a member 
            of the royal family of the fictional African country of Wakanda. Wakanda was depicted as a peculiar mix
            of futuristic technology and traditional life, a dichotomy produced by the presence in the country of
            Vibranium, a rare and nearly indestructible meteoric ore. After the death of his father at the hands
            of the villainous Ulysses Klaw, T’Challa claimed the throne as well as the mantle of the Black Panther.
            Upon becoming the Black Panther, T’Challa was exposed to a mystical herb that enhanced his strength and
            agility to near-superhuman levels.<br>
