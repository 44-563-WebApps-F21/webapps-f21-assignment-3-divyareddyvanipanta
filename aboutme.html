        <h1>My Mother</h1>
        <p>
            A Mother, is the most sacrificing person anyone can ever think of. For most of us, she is our first hero 
            and we realise this only over the years as we see more of life to understand what she really means to us.<br>
            For me, my mother is my hero. She has played an important role in shaping me as a person through her 
            thoughts and her teachings. My Superpower is, Whenever I am in depair or lost in thoughts I think of my 
            mother and she gives me the strength to move ahead in life.
